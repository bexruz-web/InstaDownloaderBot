# InstaDownloaderBot
With this bot, you can download any video from Instagram.


If you want to clone and use the bot, you need to set the BOT_TOKEN, API_URL, KEY, and HOST.

This bot works using APIs from the RapidAPI platform. You need to choose the API that suits you and get its key.

Each API returns a response in a different JSON format. If you change the API, you may need to adjust the code to process the response accordingly.

I used exactly this API: (https://rapidapi.com/diyorbekkanal/api/instagram-post-reels-stories-downloader-api)
